# Linear-reg-for-diabetes-dataset
 Project Overview
This project builds a Linear Regression model to predict diabetes progression based on various medical factors. We use the Diabetes dataset available in Scikit-learn, which contains real-world medical data
📂 Dataset Details
The dataset includes 10 medical features for diabetes patients, with the target variable representing disease progression after one year.

Features:
>Age (years)
>Sex
>Body Mass Index (BMI)
>Blood Pressure (BP)
>Serum Measurements (S1 to S6)

Target Variable:
>Diabetes Progression (a continuous value measuring disease progression)

📌 Model Approach
>Load Dataset – Using Scikit-learn’s built-in diabetes dataset.
>Data Preprocessing – Normalize features for better model performance.
>Train Linear Regression Model – Fit a regression model to predict diabetes progression.
>Evaluate Performance – Measure model accuracy using Mean Squared Error (MSE) & R² Score.

🛠️ Technologies Used
>Python
>Scikit-learn (for dataset & Linear Regression)
>Pandas (for data handling)
>Matplotlib & Seaborn (for visualization)

Future Improvements
>Use Polynomial Regression for better non-linear relationships.
>Implement Feature Selection to improve model accuracy.
>Test with other regression models (Ridge, Lasso).
